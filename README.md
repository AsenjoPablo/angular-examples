# Pablo's Angular quick doc

## What is this project about?
In this project, I aim to use basic to advanced Angular concepts for later review. It is a sample web application (SPA) using Router.

## What should it be used for?
I will be trying to integrate all Angular-related concepts which could be required to use in the future, therefore providing a quick way to review everything.

## Should I use this for my own learning purposes?
I would advise against that. You can check the way it's being built, but I *strongly* recommend you to build your own project, as following my exact structure might not be best suited for you.
